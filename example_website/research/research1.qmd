This is an example of a research project.

I did some stuff, loaded some data, plotted some graphs.

## Overview

This is just a really brief demo of plotting a graph



```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```



```{r}
iris %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species )) +
geom_point()

```

We learned some interesting things
